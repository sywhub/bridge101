# Bridge 101
This is a simple tool to teach beginner bridge players on the basics of hand evaluation, bidding, and suit play.  It is 100% client-side code, which means you can download files to your local machine and point your browser to the "index.html".  There is no need to host these file on a server and find an URL to serve it up.

The "engine" of the code is a set of codified bridge bidding rules roughly complied with SAYC, with some optional conventions.  If I github those files separately, they will be under a different repository.  For now, all the dependent files have been copied over here, with very little documentation.

## Usage
For the bidding exercises (left drop-down), after clicking "Go", a mouse click near the exercise text displays the computerized answer.  Those answer may not be the best or most correct one, just what the algorithm thinks correct one.  "Suit play" section offers no solution.  It was meant to be discussed.

## Files
The key files are "index.html", "controls.js", "suitplay.js", "bidexamples.js" and "ptexamples.js".  These are not complicated code. Most of it use the "engine" and setup HTML display.  Other JavaScript files are part of the above mentioned "engine" that I may provide documentation in a different repository.

The PowerPoint slide deck is what I used to teach a class using this tool.
